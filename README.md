# Trinity Telegram Bot
Trinity is the official AI/ML and Data Science club of **Army Institute of Technology, Pune**. We are developing a telegram bot for our club so that everyone gets benefitted from the resources, gets ideas of our club events, to increase our reach, gain project insights, get to know of our projects, boast of our achievements and contribute toward the club by providing invalueable suggestions and contributions to some project that we are working at.


The project is made completely in **Python** programming language.


The important packages required for this project are put in **requirements.txt** file and can easily be downloaded by the command - 

  pip install -r requirements.txt


You also need to have Telegram installed in your PC/Phone and a telegram account of yourself.


To create the bot first open Telegram app on your device and in the searchbar search **botfather**. Select the BotFather bot and start conversation with the bot.


Use the command **/newbot** to create a new bot for yourself and follow the procedure it asks you to follow like naming the bot, choosing a username for the bot that ends with "bot", etc.

You can use the **/help** command to look for any command to edit the bot like **/setdescription** or **/setabout**, etc.


Your bot has been created. Now is the time to add functionalities to your bot. Plan the commands that will be used in your bot. The commands that are being used in our bot are listed below.
